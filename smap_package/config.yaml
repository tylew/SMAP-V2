      Welcome to the Solar Microgrid Analysis Processor (SMAP), by the [Clean Coalition](http://www.clean-coalition.org).
                    
      Here you will find tools for the essential steps in sizing a solar microgrid for a home, site, or facility, based
      on the Clean Coalition's experience and expertise.

    title: Time Series Data Cleaner
    description: 
      'The Meter Data Cleaner cleans load data. Specific steps include:
            
        1. Flagging duplicate and missing timestamps
        
        2. Flagging zero values (optional)
            
        3. Infering an ideal timestamp sequence
            
        4. Calculating filler values for flagged timestamps
            
        5. Merging the original data with the filler values to create a continuous series

    label: Aggregated Profiles Spreadsheet
    title: APS Page
    description: '
            The Aggregated Profiles Spreadsheet (APS) includes exactly 6 columns:

            
            Time Stamp, Baseline Load Profile, Adjustment Load Profile, Master Load Profile, Critical Load Profile, and Solar Generation Profile.
            '
    instructions: 'Create an Aggregated Profiles Spreadsheet by uploading the appropriate files in the sidebar to the left.
            
            Four inputs are required:
            
            * _The Timestamp column will be defined automatically as equally spaced 15-minute intervals for the year before right now._
            
            1. The **Baseline** Profile an *.xslx sheet with a 2-column [timestamp, value_kWh] structure in the first tab (subsequent tabs are ignored)
            
            2. The **Adjustment** profile can be defined by a a 2-column *.xlsx file, or left as "None"* _The Master profile will be the sum of the Baseline and Adjustment profiles at each timestep_
    
              
            3. The **Critical** Load profile can be defined by a two-column spreadsheet, as a percentage of the Baseline load profile, or as a percentage of the Master load profile  
            
            4. Finally, the **Solar** Generation Profile can be defined by a Helioscope output CSV file or a two-column *.xlsx file'
